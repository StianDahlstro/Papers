- An Introduction to Arbitrage Trading Strategies:
  - Arbitrage trading strategies are a class of trading strategies that involve buying and selling financial instruments to take advantage of price discrepancies. The goal of arbitrage trading is to make a profit from the differences in prices between securities or markets, without taking on significant directional risk. Arbitrage trading strategies typically rely on quantitative analysis and mathematical models to identify mispricing and execute trades quickly before the market adjusts. In this article, we will introduce five popular arbitrage trading strategies and provide a simple example and reference materials for each strategy.

- Automated Market Making and Arbitrage Profits in the Presence of Fees:
  - We consider the impact of trading fees on the profits of arbitrageurs trading against an
automated marker marker (AMM) or, equivalently, on the adverse selection incurred by liquidity
providers due to arbitrage. We extend the model of Milionis et al. [2022] for a general class
of two asset AMMs to both introduce fees and discrete Poisson block generation times. In our
setting, we are able to compute the expected instantaneous rate of arbitrage profit in closed
form. When the fees are low, in the fast block asymptotic regime, the impact of fees takes a
particularly simple form: fees simply scale down arbitrage profits by the fraction of time that
an arriving arbitrageur finds a profitable trade.
